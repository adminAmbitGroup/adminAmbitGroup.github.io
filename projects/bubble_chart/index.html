          <p>The Department of Education’s (ED) mission is “to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.” ED’s congressional budget includes appropriations for various education programs. These programs are executed via grant awards to State Education Agencies (SEA) and Local Education Agencies (LEA – i.e. school district). These programs differ from Pell Grants and Student Loans which directly aid individuals. In FY16 the amount appropriated was $44 billion.</p>
          <p>Every bubble on the right represents a sub-program composed of open grants. There are over 270 sub-programs that each support a different educational cause. The bubble size reflects the total amount awarded. The color of the bubble represents the funding available as a percentage of the award amount. Hovering over a bubble will provide detailed information on the sub-program. Use the buttons above to explore more about grant programs at ED.</p>

      <div class="formdisctext">
          <p>Grants come in two major categories, Formula and Discretionary. Formula grants are congressionally approved funds distributed based on a formula. Any qualified SEA or LEA can request their funding amount which is calculated off the relevant demographic numbers. Discretionary grants are awarded based on merit and eligibility. Grantees submit applications. Then a competitive review process occurs and a final funding decision is made by ED.</p>
          <p>As of 1 January 2017, there was $7.1 billion in discretionary commitments and $32 billion in formula. These commitments will differ from the annual budget because some grants are awarded for multiple years. However, all grants are funded annually over their lifespan. Over the next year grantees will spend down funds and new grants will be awarded. The information visualized with the bubbles update daily.</p>

      <div class="prinofftext">
         <p>Each sub-program is grouped under its respective Principal Offices. Programs, and their sub-programs, are administered by different offices at ED. Each Principal Office focuses on supporting specific national education efforts. Hover over the acronym to see the office’s full name. There are also 10 regional offices that provide points of contact and assistance for schools, parents, and citizens.
